# time-capsule-creator

I want to create a Virtual Time Capsule website where users can craft digital time capsules containing messages, images, videos, and documents to be securely locked and automatically unveiled on a specified future date. The site will feature user account creation, a capsule customization tool, a secure time-locking mechanism, options for private or public sharing, and notifications for upcoming capsule openings, enabling users to reflect on past moments, celebrate milestones, or leave legacies for future generations.
